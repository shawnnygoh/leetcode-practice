# 141. Linked List Cycle

**Difficulty: Easy**

**Data Structures: Linked List**

**Algorithm: Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm / Hare-Tortoise Algorithm**

**Useful links:** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyds-cycle-finding-algorithm/

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.



**Example 1:**

![Linked List for Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

![Linked List for Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

![Linked List for Example 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
